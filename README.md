# Crowdfunding_ETL
A Practice ETL Project
This project builds a mini-ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Lastly, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

The files in this repo are as follows: 
1. ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_CDavis: This notebook imports two excel files, cleans the data, and creates 4 csv files. 
2 crowdfunding_db_schema.sql: This file is the schema for creating a database from the 4 csv files
3. Crowdfunding DB ERD: This is an ERD describing the relationship between the 4 tables in the crowdfunding_db
4. Resources: This folder contains the original excel files and the 4 csv files that form the basis for the sql database. 
5. Query Results and Screenshots: This file contains csv files exported from PG Admin after the db was created. This is for reference only.
